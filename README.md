I built a Python program using the following, these need to be installed for this program to work: ðŸ‘‡

ðŸ‘‰ pytube - A python library ------- to install it in your IDE command is :- **pip install pytube** _pytube is a genuine, lightweight, dependency-free Python library (and command-line utility) for downloading YouTube videos._

ðŸ‘‰ ffmpeg- The ffmpeg is a cross-platform & open-source software utility to record, convert and stream video/audio files

( You have to unzip the file and install the ffmpeg and add ffmpeg to path using Environment variables ) It can be used to:
1.Change the format of a video/audio file 
2.Extract audio from video file 
3.Merge audio and video streams 
4.Change the bitrate of a video/audio file 
5.Create GIF from a video file 
6.Extract still images from a video file 
7.To embed subtitles into a video file 
8.To compress or resize a video/audio file 9.Record a live stream

**Caution!!!**

You have to change the ciper.py file located in the **libs** folder of the python ( you have to look for it where you installed your python)

further instruction are here on this website :  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70780156/why-is-pytube-throwing-error-when-downloading-youtube-video
for your reference, i will upload a cipher.py file myself but the thing is the youtube function pattern changes from time to time so you have to do a little effort if my file(cipher.py) does not work for you !! 
so, what you have to do is first close all the IDEs and then go to the main fodler where you installed python then go to **libs** folder and search for "cipher.py" replace that file with mine viola you are done!!! close everything and run the program
